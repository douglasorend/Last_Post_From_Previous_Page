[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod makes changes to the forum so that the last post from the previous page in that thread is displayed as the first post on the next page.  So if the forum only shows 10 posts per page, then page 1 has 10 posts (posts 1 thru 10), the page 2 and above will have 11 (posts 10 thru 20, 20 thru 30, etc)....
